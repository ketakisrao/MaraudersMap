The castle is the main building of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, regarded as the finest wizarding school in the world. Hogwarts is built in a valley area \u2014 surrounding mountains are part of the landscape \u2014 with the fairly large Great Lake to the south of the main building.The huge main oak front doors leading into the Entrance Hall face the west, and open up to sloping lawns.The deep Forbidden Forest extends around to the west of the castle.There are also exterior greenhouses and vegetable patches on the school grounds.",img:"images/Hogwarts.png"},{name:"Hogsmeade",position:{top:"50px",left:"50px"},link:"/hogsmeade",des:"Hogsmeade Village, or simply called Hogsmeade, is the only all-wizarding village in Britain.
